Fate / Annulment of Sorrow (Fate/AoS) 
Genre: Dark Fantasy, Cosmic Horror, Psychological Tragedy 
Rating: M+ (Body horror, existential dread, explicit language, mental collapse) 

Stories do not end when they are written. They persist, deform, and demand witnesses.

F/AOS is a fan-made fate visual novel where you play as an unassuming protagonist, a philosophy and theology student at St. Alia University, somewhere in northern Illinois. Despite your greatest attempts for stagnancy and comfortability during your tenure as a student, circumstances beyond your knowledge or control have made you a keystone for the events that follow.

Holy Grail War.

What does this mean for you, who knows nothing of magecraft? Someone who has never successfully cast a spell, even if they tried?

What kind of person do you become if you could?

NOTE: Like all type-moon works out there, prior knowledge of any games is not required, only beneficial. This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.

This game is, obviously, a work in progress. The code is rushed, the assets are unclean, the words - though bulky enough right now - don't really push anything quite yet.

FTB: 3 days. Locked in and lost my f*cking marbles.

Honestly...

Would do it again.

Yeah.

Might KEEP doing it.
